# Traffic Volume Prediction
This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting traffic volume using a dataset from Google Colab.

# Project Overview
The project aims to analyze traffic patterns and build machine learning models to predict traffic volume based on features like time of day, day of the week, and junction.

# Files
shestem-assignment.ipynb or shestem-assignment.py: The main notebook or script containing the data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Sequential Model), evaluation, and analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
# Data
The analysis is based on a dataset containing historical traffic volume data, including DateTime, Junction, Vehicles, and a unique ID.

# Analysis and Modeling
The project includes:

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling features.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand traffic trends over time, by hour, and by day of the week.
- Implementation and evaluation of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and a Sequential Model (GRU) for traffic prediction.
- Analysis of model performance, feature importances, and significant prediction errors.

# How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine or Google Colab environment.
- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Run the shestem-assignment.ipynb notebook or execute the shestem-assignment.py script.
